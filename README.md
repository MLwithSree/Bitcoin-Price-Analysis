Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to this project where we explore, analyze, and predict Bitcoin prices using historical data and machine learning models. This notebook walks through the complete lifecycle ‚Äî from data exploration to model evaluation ‚Äî providing valuable insights into cryptocurrency market trends.

Project Objective - The goal is to predict the future price of Bitcoin based on historical price trends and time series data using supervised machine learning techniques.
